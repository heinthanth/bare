# Bare Framework.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Simple, minimal PHP framework for me. But, you can use it too! I just put packages together to make a minimal micro-framework.\
Build on top of open-source PHP packages.


## Documentation

Will document later. You'll have to know about PSR (PHP Standards Recommendations).


## Installation

Currently, under development. Simple `git clone` will help you!

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/heinthanth/bare
cd bare
composer install
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

This will make this repo alive at <http://localhost:8000>


## Core Features

No feature out of the box! - with just router, blade engine and other stuffs.


## License

The Bare Framework is licensed under the MIT license. See [License](LICENSE) for more information.
