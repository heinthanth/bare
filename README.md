# Bare Framework.

[![MIT LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/heinthanth/bare)](LICENSE)

Simple, Lightweight PHP micro-framework, without additional packages. \
Built with PHP core-features out of the box.


## Installation

Currently, under development. Simple `git clone` will help you!

``` shell script
git clone https://github.com/heinthanth/bare
cd bare
composer install
php -S localhost:8000 -t web
```

This will make this repo alive at <http://localhost:8000>


## Core Features

Everything is written from scratch. No external dependencies. \
Just hack it as what you need. I just shipped `bare` with simple regex Router and some utilities.
